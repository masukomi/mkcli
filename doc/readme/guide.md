### Defining Programs

This section covers what you need to know to define a program as markdown, the important rules to remember are:

* The first level one heading sets the program name
* A fenced code block with the info string `synopsis` sets the program synopsis
* A level two heading of `Options` declares the program options
* A level two heading of `Commands` declares the program commands

#### Program Name

The program name is extracted from the first level one heading:

```markdown
# prg
```

Which creates a program named `prg`.

#### Program Description

The program description is created from all block level elements from the first level one heading until the next heading is encountered:

```markdown
# prg

Short description.

An extended description that can include paragraphs, lists, code blocks and other block level elements.
```

#### Program Synopsis

A program synopsis can be specified with a fenced code block that uses the info string `synopsis`.

    ```synopsis
    [options] [file...]
    ```

#### Program Options

Program options are declared with a level two heading matching `Options` and a list following the heading:

```markdown
# prg

## Options

* `-i, --input [FILE...]` Input files
* `-o, --output [FILE]` Output file
```

#### Manual Sections

A level two heading that does not begin an options or commands list is treated as a section for man page output:

```markdown
# prg

## Environment

The environment variable FOO changes the behaviour to `bar`.
```

The section ends when the next heading is encountered.
